#My Vim Configuration

##Introduction

This vimrc file started off with just basic features and preferences that I wished to include in my vim usage. Over time, I have added support for extension managers and other plugins, such as NERDTree.

##Currently Used Plugins
- Pathogen
- NERDTree

###Pathogen

Pathogen is an extension manager for vim that ensures all plugins and runtime files have their own private directories.

###NERDTree

NERDTree provides a way for us to explore the file system visually and open files and directories accordingly.
